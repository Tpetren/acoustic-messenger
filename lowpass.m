function [iWaveformFiltered, qWaveformFiltered] = lowpass(iWaveform, qWaveform, fsfd)
%lowpass Lowpass filter the signal after bringing it down to baseband.
%   iWaveform - The first waveform.
%   qWaveform - The second waveform.
%   fsfd - Samples per symbol.
%   Passes the signals through a MATLAB-generated low-pass filter.

iWaveformFiltered = 0; qWaveformFiltered = 0;
