function [iWaveform, qWaveform]  = shift2baseband(waveForm, fc)
%shift2baseband Shifts the waveform to baseband.
%   waveform - The waveform to shift down.
%   fc - The carrier frequency.
%   Shifts down the 2-dimensional waveform into its orthogonal sin and cos
%   baseband signals.

iWaveform = 0; qWaveform = 0;
